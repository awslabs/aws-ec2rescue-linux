[ec2-user@localhost ~]$ wget -q https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2rescuelinux/ec2rl.tgz.sha256
[ec2-user@localhost ~]$ sha256sum -c ec2rl.tgz.sha256
ec2rl.tgz: OK
```

        modules for analyzing issues on Linux instances on AWS.

USAGE:
    ec2rl [subcommand] [parameters]

COMMANDS:
  The following are the accepted subcommands:
    menu-config    - use a text-based menu system to create a configuration file, configuration.cfg
    save-config    - use the provided arguments to create a configuration file, configuration.cfg
    run            - executes modules
    list           - list available modules for platform
    upload         - upload a tarball of a directory to S3 using either a presigned URL or an AWS-support provided URL
    help           - print long help
    version        - print version and license information
    version-check  - check program version against the latest upstream version
    software-check - check for software required by modules that is not installed on the system and give install details
    bug-report     - print version information relevant for inclusion in a bug report
```

Additional usage information is available in the usage guide in docs/USAGE.md and the help subcommand output.

## Examples

ec2rl can be run with no options or special configuration.
```commandline
ec2rl run
```

Some modules require sudo/root. Utilizing sudo is required in order to run these modules if executing ec2rl as a regular user.
```commandline
sudo ec2rl run
```

Some modules require arguments for their usage. For example, most performance metric collection modules require times (number of samples to take) and period (length of sample).

```commandline
sudo ec2rl run --times=3 --period=5
```

Some modules may negatively impact system performance. These modules require the perfimpact argument to run.

```commandline
sudo ec2rl run --times=3 --period=5 --perfimpact=true
```

Some modules detect an issue and can also remediate the issue. These modules require the remediate argument to perform the remediation actions.

```commandline
sudo ec2rl run --remediate
```

## Module Development
Modules are YAML files containing either a BASH or a Python script as well as the necessary metadata. Examples are available in mod.d and the module development guide found in docs/MODULE.md

## FAQ
### Why does EC2 Rescue For Linux not have the ability to run and upload in a single command?
It is recommended the resulting data be reviewed prior to being uploaded in order to ensure that no confidential information is included.

### Why does EC2 Rescue For Linux require Python 2.7.9+? What about Python 2.7.x, x < 9?
SSL SNI (Server Name Indication) is required for the ec2rl's upload functionality, however, this wasn't added to Python 2.7 until 2.7.9. See [PEP 466](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0466/) for more information regarding the SSL changes in Python 2.7.9.

### I'm trying to use the menu on a system running SUSE, but it does not work.
Python's curses module is normally built into its standard library, however, it is sometimes separated and included as a separate package. You will need to install it with the operating system's package manager. The package name in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 is "[python-curses](https://www.suse.com/LinuxPackages/packageRouter.jsp?product=server&version=12&service_pack=&architecture=x86_64&package_name=python-curses)".
