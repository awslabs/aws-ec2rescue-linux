title: !!str Gather a copy of the /var/lib/dhclient/*.lease files
helptext: !!str |
  Gather a copy of the /var/lib/dhclient/*.lease files.  This assumes default paths.
  Modern (7.x+) RHEL/CentOS instances do not seem to come with lease files with the default configuration. However,
  they are left as supported in case a custom configuration has them being saved.
